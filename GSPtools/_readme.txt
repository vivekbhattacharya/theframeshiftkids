INTRODUCTION
---
These are a set of Matlab and Perl files inherited
from Dr. Lalit Ponnala that, in addition to detecting
frameshifts, do many, many other things. For more
information, visit our website

GETTING STARTED
---
For users, we have documented the main files to use at

    <http://code.google.com/p/theframeshiftkids/wiki/Unities>
    <http://code.google.com/p/theframeshiftkids/wiki/Pearls>
    <http://code.google.com/p/theframeshiftkids/w/list>.

among other places. As suggested, user-facing Matlab
files all end with "unity" and are stored in the "unities"
subdirectory. Perl files are merely stored in the "pearls"
directory. Documentation is available both within the code
itself and more extensively on our website, where you
can also find the mathematics behind the model.
