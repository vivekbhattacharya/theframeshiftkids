= Obtaining SVN =
  * [http://subversion.tigris.org/downloads/svn-win32-1.4.3.zip Download Subversion]
  * Zip to "C:\Program Files\" and rename "svn-win32-1.4.3" to "Subversion"
  * Control Panel -> System -> Advanced -> Environment Variables -> System Variables -> Edit PATH, which is something like {{{C:\Gobbledegook;C:\ArcaneMagic\;C:\Viruses}}}
  * Change that to {{{C:\Gobbledegook;C:\ArcaneMagic\;C:\Viruses;C:\Program Files\Subversion\bin}}}
  * OK, OK, OK, OK until you exit all the dialogs
  * Go to Command Prompt and type `svn --version`. If you get something, the success is upon you.

= Pulling =
  * Decide upon your workspace directory. Mine will be {{C:\Workspace\FrameshiftRepo}}.
  * Open Command Prompt, and `cd` to {{C:\Workspace}}.
  * Type `svn checkout https://theframeshiftkids.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ FrameshiftRepo --username bob` where bob is your username (e.g. `nemosupport` or `drvitek`).
  * Permanently accept the certificate and [http://code.google.com/hosting/settings enter your password.]
  * Voila! `cd` into `FrameshiftRepo` and you're set to go.
