== Terminology ==
  * [Unities]
  * [Pearls]

== What's New in Version One ==
Easter release using a tentative but broken sinusoidal model.
  * 1.1: Rereleased with Lalit's deterministic model but with all the other changes we've made since then. That is, we've merely written a new `displacement.m` function. We've also removed files made irrelevant with a non-stochastic model such as every single unity file except `unity.m`. Also, it's Web-enabled like 3.1. Hizzy yeah!

== What's New in Version Three ==
  * 3.0
   * Unused functions deleted but available from [http://theframeshiftkids.googlecode.com/svn/tags/2+some/GSPtools/ the archives];
   * `fcalcmpx` split up;
   * `megaunity` now several times faster;
   * new `cornerstone.pl` parses Genbank search results; and
   * no more fudging with free2bind
   * Several boosts to clarity in code
  * 3.1
    * `opportunity.m`: Spits out superimposed displacement plots for rainy day family slideshows
    * `impunity.m`: Puts the yields for all sequences in a folder into a `results.txt` file
    * `unity.m` and `megaunity.m` and `cornerstone.pl` now web-enabled
    * `fabio.pl` (web-enabled): Parses TAV frequencies and spits them back out in the order of `Codons.mat`, i.e. spits out new `TAV.mat` for new species
    * Better documentation all around
    * All the unities should be slightly faster now that we're using OpenGL
  * 3.14
    * Back frameshifts detected. Every function that took a forward frameshift parameter now takes a back frameshift parameter as well.
    * `dysentery.pl` will convert amino acid primary structure sequences to codon sequences, randomly choosing codons. In addition, it verifies hand-customized codon sequences against a primary structure sequence.
    * Update to the stochastic model: sine and cosine bounded for more accurate results.
    * `jejunity.m` plots the average path taken by the codon in addition to error bars. It takes the same commands as `opportunity.m` as they both convey the same information in two different, cool ways.
