== What's New in Version Three ==

=== 3.1415 ===
  * All changes from 4.0 backported
  * Extensive documentation for the `Kidnap` module (Issue 3)
  * Optional arguments for `megaunity` (Issue 1); for usage, see in-file documentation
  * Model now detects stop codons and unusually long wait times (`displacement.m`)
  * Mathematical error in `excos` and `exsin` fixed
  * `alopeciaunity.m` saves polar plots in batches, similar to what `opportunity.m` and `jejunity.m` do for overlay and error bar plots
  * `impunity.m` handles single files in addition to folders now. Try it out with `impunity('prfb.txt', {'uga,25'}, {}, 100)`.
  * Performance increase in `cumm_mag_phase.m` and Kidnap

=== 3.141 (r156) ===
  * `Travel.mat` memoizes `nloopcalc.m` and combines `TAV.mat` and `Codons.mat`, making it redundant. Huge performance increases resulted because `nloopcalc` was called so many times.
  * `dysentery.pl --rcheck`

=== 3.14 ===
  * Back frameshifts are now detected. Every function that took a forward frameshift parameter now takes a back frameshift parameter as well.
  * `dysentery.pl` will convert amino acid primary structure sequences to codon sequences, randomly choosing codons. In addition, it verifies hand-customized codon sequences against a primary structure sequence.
  * Sine and cosine in calculating window function now bounded for more accurate results.
  * `jejunity.m` plots the average path taken by the codon in addition to error bars. It takes the same commands as `opportunity.m` as they both convey the same information in two different, cool ways.

=== 3.1 ===
  * `opportunity.m`: Spits out superimposed displacement plots for rainy day family slideshows
  * `impunity.m`: Puts the yields for all sequences in a folder into a `results.txt` file
  * `unity.m` and `megaunity.m` and `cornerstone.pl` now web-enabled
  * `fabio.pl` (web-enabled): Parses TAV frequencies and spits them back out in the order of `Codons.mat`, i.e. spits out new `TAV.mat` for new species

=== 3 ===
  * Unused functions deleted but available from [http://theframeshiftkids.googlecode.com/svn/tags/2+some/GSPtools/ the archives]
  * `fcalcmpx` split up and `megaunity` now several times faster
  * new `cornerstone.pl` parses Genbank search results and
  * no more fudging with free2bind

== What's New in Version Four (r212) ==
  * reloop and sofar gone, q.v. BecomingHarsher
  * The ThrushBaby algorithm

  * free2bind, refactored to Kidnap, heavily edited (from 9000 lines to 2000)
   * Now extensible with other parameter modules and readable
   * !SantaLucia module depreciated due to lack of key subroutines
   * free2bind no longer a requirement for installation
  * Performance increase in `diff_vectors.m`

== Why Version 1.1 ==
We re-released with Lalit's deterministic model merged other changes we've made since 3.1, merely replacing 3.1's `displacement.m`. Therefore it's web-enabled and has 3.1's Perl tools and performance.
