#labels Featured,changes

== Terminology ==
  * [Unities]
  * [Pearls]

== What's New in Version ... ==
  * Three: Unused functions deleted but available from [http://theframeshiftkids.googlecode.com/svn/tags/2+some/GSPtools/ the archives];
   * `fcalcmpx` split up;
   * `megaunity` now several times faster;
   * new `cornerstone.pl` parses Genbank search results; and
   * no more fudging with free2bind
   * Several boosts to clarity in code
   * 3.1
    * `opportunity.m`: Spits out superimposed displacement plots for rainy day family slideshows
    * `impunity.m`: Puts the yields for all sequences in a folder into a `results.txt` file
    * `unity.m` and `megaunity.m` and `cornerstone.pl` now web-enabled
    * `fabio.pl` (web-enabled): Parses TAV frequencies and spits them back out in the order of `Codons.mat`, i.e. spits out new `TAV.mat` for new species
    * Better documentation all around
    * All the unities should be slightly faster now that we're using OpenGL
