#summary Describes the thrushbaby algorithm, which is designed to automatically change codons in a sequence to increase yield.
#labels thrushbaby,algorithm,frameshift,optimization

= Introduction =

The premise of this algorithm is that "bumps" in a gene's displacement plot affect frameshifts (choosing the wrong codon) later in the graph.  Thus, "smoothing out" a graph from the start will reduce the number of frameshifts predicted by the model.


= Details =

Steps of Algorithm:
    * Identifies areas with large amounts of frameshifting--i.e., volatile areas where the ribosome does not choose the right codon often.
    * Selects an area four codons 5' of the target codon.
    * Randomly permutes with synonyms of these four codons to minimize frameshifting at or near that given codon. (NOTE: It does NOT try to optimize _yield_ by permuting codons.)
    * Repeats the process for multiple volatile areas.

= Important Note =

Thrushbaby is especially effective if run multiple times, each time on the improved sequence.
