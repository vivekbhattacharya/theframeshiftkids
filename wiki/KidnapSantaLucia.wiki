As it stands, this module for Kidnap::Bind lacks a `terminal_doublet` function. This project currently lacks an interest in using !SantaLucia, but those interested may find this [http://theframeshiftkids.googlecode.com/files/SantaLucia-unfinished.pl mysterious and elusive file] in the Downloads section. Please refer to `SantaLucia, John, PNAS (1998) Vol. 95, pp. 1460-1465` for the data required. Also, refer to `Kidnap::Freier` and `Kidnap:XiaMathews` for hints and style on how to implement a Kidnap::Bind module.
