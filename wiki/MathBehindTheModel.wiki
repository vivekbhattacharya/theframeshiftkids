#summary Calculating probabilities in stochastically

There are three probabilities to be computed: P.abc, P.bcd, and P.reloop where "abc" is the current codon, "bcd" is the next codon (if a frameshift occurs), and "reloop" is the action that occurs when we recalculate the probabilities, simulating the ribosome's staying in one place.

We know P.abc = 1 - P.fail.abc, so all we have to do is compute P.fail.abc, which obeys this simple equation: P.fail' = P.fail * (1 - cos(displacement)^10/(Nloop at current)) where P.fail' is the probability of failure at the next codon and P.fail was the probability at the previous codon. Thus, this is a cumulative model and is awesome.

Nloop is how long the ribosome stays at the codon.
