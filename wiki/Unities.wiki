  * unity.m
    * unity.m, given a sequence, will produce a displacement and "force" plot in addition to spitting out the genes where the model detected a frameshift, which may or may not be the actual frameshift sites. For example, prfB will sometimes frameshift on `{'cua,26'}` instead of `{'uga,25'}`.

  * megaunity.m
    * megaunity.m, given a sequence and a cell array of correct frameshifts, will output a yield where yield is the probability that a ribosome will correctly read and frameshift the sequence according to the model. For example, prfB has a yield of approximately 93%, which is an A.

  * impunity.m
    * impunity.m, given a work folder, a cell array of correct frameshifts, and an iteration limit, will calculate yield for all the sequences in that folder and store those results in a `results.txt` file in the current work folder.

  * opportunity.m
    * opportunity.m, given a work folder and an iteration limit, will generate superimposed displacement plots as PNG files into a `thepictureshow` subdirectory of the work folder. How many superimposed images? The iteration limit.
    
  * jejunity.m
    * jejunity.m takes the same arguments as opportunity.m except it generates an error bar plot instead. This is widely considered to be the coolest unity ever.
    
  * alopeciaunity.m
    * alopeciaunity takes a folder and saves the polar plot for each sequence inside said folder in a `merryround` subdirectory. No limit is required because polar plots are deterministic and not stochastic, unlike the displacement plots.
