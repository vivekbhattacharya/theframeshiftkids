The first step is to copy the SVN repository to a different place,
which will preserve the ancient and beautiful history of our code.
You'll need an intermediate directory on your local hard drive to do
so. For example, "C:/repos/BWFtools-copy". To do so, open the command
prompt and type

{{{
> cd C:/repos/
> svnadmin create BWFtools-copy
> svnsync init file:///repos/BWFtools-copy http://theframeshiftkids.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/GSPtools
> synsync sync file:///repos/BWFtools-copy
[long time]
}}}

Now suppose you opened a Google Code Project Hosting account and your
HTTPS SVN URL was "https://me.googlecode.com/svn/trunk". (You could
stop there, but you could also stick this code in a subdirectory, such
as "http://me.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/my-tools".) A note about
naming: BWFtools is an unregistered trademark, and you cannot use it
in creating a name for your project.

To copy your temporary repository over to the one on Google, do

{{{
> cd C:/repos/
> svnsync init -u username https://me.../trunk file:///repos/BWFtools-copy
> svnsync sync -u username https://me.../trunk
[long time]
}}}

where "username" is your Google Code username. The full process
[http://code.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=56673&topic=10386 is documented by Google].

The second thing you'll have to do is add this license to all code
files (or in a "COPYING" file under the trunk or on a web page, even
if neither of these two options are kosher).

You also must retain `_COPYING` under "/pearls/Kidnap" and its original
text in some form accessible to all project contributors and users.
